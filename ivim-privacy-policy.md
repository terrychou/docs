# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collection and usage in app iVim on iOS.


## Information collection and usage

On our own, we **never** share iVim's data, such as its configuration files or your own documents, with any outside parties.

iVim is a freemium app. It is offered to you free of charge in general. But some of its features may require purchasing via In-App Purchase to be enabled. iVim does **not** embed any comercial Ads.

### Accounts

You do **not** need an account to use iVim. However, you may need an Apple ID to do the IAP purchasing when necessary.

### Third party

With your authorization, iVim may share files or some other information, on your behalf, with other apps installed on the same device, or services such as iCloud. 

You should be aware that the privacy policies of those apps or services may differ from our own.

### Data cache

In order to implement certain functionalities, we may cache some data from files or memory within the app on the same device. This cached data will only be utilized by the app and **never** be exposed outside the app.

### Log Data

In case of errors in the app, we may collect information on your device called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device name, operating system version, the configuration or settings of the app, the time and date of your use of the app, or other statistics.


## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For example, all the documents are protected under the sandboxed filesystem in iOS. Sensitive information, such as IAP, is stored in system Keychain and securied by iOS.


## Your Consent
