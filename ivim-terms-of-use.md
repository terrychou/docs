# Terms of Use

Last updated: August 20, 2021

The mobile application iVim (the "App") is made available to you by Boogaloo ("we", "us" or "our") and subject to these Terms of Use, including those set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/terrychou/docs/blob/master/ivim-privacy-policy.md) (the "Terms").

By accessing or using the App, you agree to follow and be bound by the Terms, which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you.

We and third party providers may make improvements and/or changes in the products, services, features, programs and prices described in the App at any time without notice. 

If you do not agree with the Terms, please do not use this App.

BY CONTINUING TO USE THE APP, YOU ARE INDICATING YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS AND ALL REVISIONS THEREOF.

Certain provisions of the Terms may be supplemented or superseded by expressly designated legal notices or terms located on particular pages at this App.

We reserve the right, at any time and from time to time, to modify or discontinue, termporarily or permanently, the App or any portion thereof with or without notice. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the App or any portion thereof.

## Purchases

From time to time, we may provide features and services for purchase in the App (the "In App Purchase") through the App Store. If you choose to make an In App Purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the App Store, and the payment at the price displayed to you will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase.

### Subscriptions

Some In App Purchases may be purchased on a subscription basis. If you choose to purchase a subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase, and then on a recurring and periodic basis according to the subscription plan.

The subscription automatically renews unless it is cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions at any time by going to your Account Settings on the App Store after purchase.

### Free Trial

We may, at our sole discretion, offer a subscription with an introductory free trial for a limited period of time.

You will not be charged at the start of a free trial. Unless you cancelled the subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription fees within 24 hours prior to the end of the free trial.

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue a free trial offer, at any time without notice.

### Price Changes

We, in our sole discretion and at any time, may modify the price of any In App Purchase.

Any subscription price change will become effective at the end of then-current period. You will be noticed of the price change of any subscription that affects you and have an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the related features or services after the subscription price change comes into effect, indicates your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee.

Any price change of other In App Purchase will only affect their future purchases.

### Refunds

Refunds are subject to iTunes/App Store refund policies. We cannot grant refunds for purchases charged to your Apple ID. You will have to contact the App Store support for that.

## Intellectual Property

You acknowledge and agree that the App and any necessary software used in connection with the App, if any, contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted hereunder.

## Termination

You agree that we may, without prior notice or liability, immediately terminate your access to the App, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
